# AutoCalibration
Automatic cross calibration between image and lidar

ABOUT
=====
  This is a reference implementation of mutual information 
  (MI) based algorithm for automatic extrinsic calibration 
  of a 3D laser scanner and optical camera system in python. You can 
  find specific details in the original paper:
  
  "Automatic Targetless Extrinsic Calibration of a 3D Lidar 
  and Camera by Maximizing Mutual Information." in AAAI, 
  special track on robotics, July 2012, Toronto, Canada.
  
  Only grid search implementation is included for now.
